        In case you're looking at this and wondering "Why in the hell did count
        only go up to four!?!! Well, that's because you never told the computer
        that the number zero (0) does not count. If you don't want zero to count,
        make sure that the first initializaton starts with the number above the 
        one you want it to start off with.
        
        i.e.: I want to start at 22, but do not want to exclude, first part of 
        this FOR statement should be "count = 22"
